I'm a Senior Security Engineer with deep expertise across IT Service Management, Network Security, Identity & Access Management, Governance, Risk, and Compliance, and DevOps/Platform Engineering. With certifications including CISA, CySA+, PenTest+, Security+, ITIL 4, and ICS-400, I specialize in building resilient, secure, and efficient technology operations.

## Featured Projects

### [Infrastructure Security Scanner](https://github.com/petorske/infrastructure-security-scanner)

A Python-based AWS security scanner that audits cloud infrastructure against CIS benchmarks, surfacing misconfigurations across S3, IAM, and network resources with actionable remediation guidance.

**Stack:** Python · Boto3 · Click
**Output:** Console · JSON
**Compliance:** CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

In a sandbox scan of 4 test S3 buckets, the scanner identified **14 findings** (2 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM, 4 LOW) — including publicly accessible buckets, missing KMS encryption, disabled versioning, and absent access logging — each mapped to specific CIS controls.
